- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation completed in one pass on 2026-09-26.
- References to route, HTTP contract, accessibility attributes, shared visual assets and exact presentation values are explicit product/interface constraints supplied by the requester, not implementation choices.
- The security stanza in Feature 004 still names API key authentication; Feature 006 is the later dependency that authorizes Bearer JWT. The spec records this precedence and keeps `X-API-KEY` outside the web frontend.
